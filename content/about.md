WSU’s R Working Group was started in Spring of 2016 by [Alli N. Cramer](https://www.allicramer.com/) in conjunction with [CEREO](https://cereo.wsu.edu/). The group, founded by a PhD student, is focused on peer-to-peer learning through student, post-doc, and faculty-lead seminars. [Michael Meyer](https://labs.wsu.edu/hampton/people/michael-meyer/) and [Matthew Brousil](https://labs.wsu.edu/hampton/people/matthew-brousil/) are the current organizers.

No matter what your experience with R, we’d love to have you join us. R is a constantly evolving open source platform, so we are all always learning.

Contact us by joining our [list-serv](https://lists.wsu.edu/mailman/listinfo/r_working_grp), following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CougRstats), or emailing one of us directly:
