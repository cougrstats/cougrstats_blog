Brand new to R? You can install R from CRAN [here](https://www.r-project.org/). You can also download RStudio, an interactive development environment (IDE) for R from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Good news: both R and RStudio are free!

Want a more guided installation experience? Check out [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU)video about installing R on Windows, or [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg)video about installing R on Mac. (Both videos from Software Carpentry.)
