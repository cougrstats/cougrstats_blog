_By Matt Brousil_

In this post I'll walk through some of the basics for getting started importing, formatting, and creating maps with spatial data in R. Many students and researchers I know (myself included) have taken GIS coursework and are familiar with tools like ArcMap, but want to work with their data in R. R provides a good alternative to costly and potentially less reproducibility-friendly GIS tools, but it can be challenging to get started! This walkthrough is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully it will provide enough to give you a foothold and begin learning independently. I'll assume you know a bit about GIS to begin with.

In order to follow along with this walkthrough you'll want to install and load the following packages:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(cowplot)
library(ggspatial)
```

### 1. Quickly plot data for coordinate points

One of the more straightforward things you might want to do with mapping in R is to plot some points.

The built-in `quakes` dataset in R is an easy place for us to start. This dataset provides info on earthquakes near Fiji.

Take a look:

```r
head(quakes)

##      lat   long depth mag stations
## 1 -20.42 181.62   562 4.8       41
## 2 -20.62 181.03   650 4.2       15
## 3 -26.00 184.10    42 5.4       43
## 4 -17.97 181.66   626 4.1       19
## 5 -20.42 181.96   649 4.0       11
## 6 -19.68 184.31   195 4.0       12
```

We have a column for the latitude of earthquake observations, one for the longitude, and then additional ones for the depth, magnitude and the number of stations reporting the quake.

Without even loading a package, you would be able to make a very basic map of these points using the `plot` function:

```r
plot(quakes$long, quakes$lat)
```

However, if you're familiar with `ggplot2` you can plot them a little more elegantly with a little bit more code:

```r
ggplot(quakes) +
  geom_point(aes(x = long, y = lat))
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_2.png)

Perhaps you'd like to make the size of the points dependent on the magnitude of the earthquake:

```r
ggplot(quakes) +
  geom_point(aes(x = long, y = lat, size = mag, alpha = 0.4))
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_3.png)

Note that right now `ggplot` isn't considering this spatial data yet, but just some points with coordinates.

From here you could take things further and format with different colors, plot themes, and plenty more. We'll dive into some of this in the following sections. But let's look at how to import our own data, plot it, and format the plot.

### 2. Build a map using external point and polygon files and add an inset

For the rest of this walkthrough I'll be using a dataset by Pagano et al.(2019) containing polar bear satellite locations obtained from GPS collars. It's available [here](https://alaska.usgs.gov/products/data.php?dataid=266). If you're following along, you'll want to download and unzip this folder.

We'll be working mostly with the `sf` package now. There are several good vignettes on the package provided [here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) and an explanation of the purpose of the package provided in [this publication](https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2018-009). Some of the basics are:

  * `sf` is built around "simple features". Simple features are a standard for storing spatial data

  * `sf` was authored by some of the same people as the earlier spatial package `sp` and allows us to work with spatial data using simple features much more effectively

  * One major benefit is that `sf` has been written to coexist well with packages in the `tidyverse`

  * `sf` doesn't work well with time series or raster data (see the [`stars`](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars) and [`raster`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/raster.pdf) packages)

  * `sf` stores spatial data in data frames (see tidyverse comment above)

#### 2.1 Import, format, test

Let's dive in. To start, we'll load in the dataset. It contains GPS collar data from several adult female polar bears.

```r
bears <- read_csv(file = "../data/polarBear_argosGPSLocations_alaska_pagano_2014.csv") %>%
  select(Bear:LocationQuality)

## Warning: Missing column names filled in: 'X7' [7], 'X8' [8], 'X9' [9]

##
## -- Column specification -----------------------------------------------------------------
## cols(
##   Bear = col_double(),
##   Type = col_character(),
##   Date = col_datetime(format = ""),
##   latitude = col_double(),
##   longitude = col_double(),
##   LocationQuality = col_character(),
##   X7 = col_logical(),
##   X8 = col_logical(),
##   X9 = col_datetime(format = "")
## )
```

You'll notice I included the `select` statement above. When reading this file in I found that it contained extra empty columns. A good reminder that it's important to look over your data when you import it into R.

What do the data look like?

```r
head(bears)

## # A tibble: 6 x 6
##    Bear Type  Date                latitude longitude LocationQuality
##   <dbl> <chr> <dttm>                 <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>
## 1     1 GPS   2014-04-10 02:00:38     70.4     -146. G
## 2     1 Argos 2014-04-10 02:19:12     70.4     -146. L3
## 3     1 Argos 2014-04-10 02:50:59     70.4     -146. LB
## 4     1 Argos 2014-04-10 02:53:19     70.4     -146. L1
## 5     1 GPS   2014-04-10 03:00:38     70.4     -146. G
## 6     1 GPS   2014-04-10 04:00:38     70.4     -146. G
```

Just like the earthquake example earlier, we can plot these to get a sense for how they're arranged spatially.

```r
ggplot(bears) +
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude))
```

![fig_4](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_4.png)

Knowing that there are multiple bears present in the dataset, we might want to color their points by their ID number. We'll do so by converting the `Bear` column to a factor so that R doesn't treat it like an ordinal or continuous variable when assigning colors.

```r
ggplot(bears) +
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = as.factor(Bear)))
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_5.png)

Another option would be to create a separate map for each bear in the study, and to indicate the progression of time using color. We'll facet by bear ID now, and color by date

```r
ggplot(bears) +
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = Date)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Bear)
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_6.png)

It's very handy to be able to plot almost directly from a .csv file like this, but we could also convert this dataset into a more spatial-friendly `sf` object. Note that we provide a CRS, or coordinate reference system here. `4326` corresponds to WGS84.

```r
bears_sf <- st_as_sf(x = bears,
                     coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                     # WGS84
                     crs = 4326)
```

NCEAS has a helpful info sheet about working with CRS in R [here](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf) if you want to learn more.

What's the result of us creating this new object?

```r
bears_sf

## Simple feature collection with 9583 features and 4 fields
## geometry type:  POINT
## dimension:      XY
## bbox:           xmin: -158.9622 ymin: 70.0205 xmax: -140.4845 ymax: 75.33249
## geographic CRS: WGS 84
## # A tibble: 9,583 x 5

##  2     1 Argos 2014-04-10 02:19:12 L3                   (-146.332 70.4)
##  3     1 Argos 2014-04-10 02:50:59 LB                 (-146.328 70.423)
##  4     1 Argos 2014-04-10 02:53:19 L1                 (-146.366 70.395)
##  5     1 GPS   2014-04-10 03:00:38 G               (-146.3469 70.39932)
##  6     1 GPS   2014-04-10 04:00:38 G               (-146.3455 70.39947)
##  7     1 Argos 2014-04-10 04:31:44 L3                 (-146.351 70.396)
##  8     1 Argos 2014-04-10 04:32:30 L2                 (-146.364 70.397)

## 10     1 GPS   2014-04-10 08:00:01 G               (-146.3419 70.40024)
## # ... with 9,573 more rows
```

We can see that the object is a tibble (data frame) but also has spatial data associated with it. The coordinate data is now stored in the `geometry` list column. If you want to pull the coordinates out of that object you can access them with `st_coordinates()`.

Plotting `sf` objects with `ggplot` is remarkably simple using a `geom_sf()` layer:

```r
ggplot(bears_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = as.factor(Bear)))
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_7.png)

#### 2.2 More complex plotting

Let's focus our efforts on plotting the GIS data for just one bear. We'll filter for bear 2's data just like we would if we were doing this operation on a normal data frame.

```r
bear_two <- bears_sf %>%
  filter(Bear == 2)
```

I'd also like to include shapefiles in my map. In this instance, we could use these to add polygon layers for the state of [Alaska](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) and for [sea ice](https://nsidc.org/data/g02135?qt-data_set_tabs=2#qt-data_set_tabs) at the time the bear was being tracked. We can use the `st_read()` function to bring in shapefiles.

```r
# Multipolygon geometry
alaska <- st_read(dsn = "../data/cb_2018_us_state_5m/cb_2018_us_state_5m.shp") %>%
  filter(NAME == "Alaska")

## Reading layer `cb_2018_us_state_5m' from data source `C:\Users\matthew.brousil\Documents\R-talks\intro_to_mapping\data\cb_2018_us_state_5m\cb_2018_us_state_5m.shp' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'
## Simple feature collection with 56 features and 9 fields
## geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON
## dimension:      XY
## bbox:           xmin: -179.1473 ymin: -14.55255 xmax: 179.7785 ymax: 71.35256
## geographic CRS: NAD83

# Sea ice from the first month that the bear was tracked
ice <- st_read(dsn = "../data/extent_N_201404_polygon_v3.0/extent_N_201404_polygon_v3.0.shp")

## Reading layer `extent_N_201404_polygon_v3.0' from data source `C:\Users\matthew.brousil\Documents\R-talks\intro_to_mapping\data\extent_N_201404_polygon_v3.0\extent_N_201404_polygon_v3.0.shp' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'
## Simple feature collection with 145 features and 1 field
## geometry type:  POLYGON
## dimension:      XY
## bbox:           xmin: -3225000 ymin: -4950000 xmax: 3425000 ymax: 5700000
## projected CRS:  NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North
```

Now these files have been brought in largely ready-to-use. Let's preview:

```r
ggplot(ice) +
  geom_sf()
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_8.png)

As a quick sidenote, the [`tigris` package for R](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) is an alternative resource for polygon data for US boundaries that you could use. It accesses shapefiles from the US Census and loads them as `sf` objects.

Now that we have three separate layers loaded in R it's worth looking to see if they have matching coordinate reference systems. For example, if you wanted to do any direct comparisons of the layers to one another for spatial analysis you'd want to make sure they were compatible. `st_crs()` will return each layer's CRS for us.

```r
st_crs(bear_two)

##     ID["EPSG",4269]]
```

Alas, the CRS of the three layers don't match.

Because the three layers all **do** have a CRS already, we'll want to do transformations to put them in the same system. For this we'll use `st_transform()`. If instead you wanted to assign a CRS to an object that did not have one you would use `st_crs()`.

```r
bear_two_pcs <- st_transform(x = bear_two, crs = 3467)

alaska_pcs <- st_transform(x = alaska, crs = 3467)

ice_pcs <- st_transform(x = ice, crs = 3467)
```

Note that these layers would have plotted successfully even if we didn't transform their CRS. But the plotting would not have been pretty.

With transformation:

```r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alaska_pcs) +
  geom_sf(data = ice_pcs) +
  geom_sf(data = bear_two_pcs)
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_9.png)

Without transformation:

```r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alaska) +
  geom_sf(data = ice) +
  geom_sf(data = bear_two)
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_10.png)

Next we'll want to zoom in a bit. It would help to know the rough spatial boundaries of the polar bear data in order to do this well. We can use `st_bbox()` to get this
information in the form of a bounding box, save it, then use it to define the boundaries of our plot. I've also added colors to differentiate the sea ice from Alaska's land area.

```r
limits <- st_bbox(bear_two_pcs)

bear_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alaska_pcs, fill = "seashell", color = "snow3") +
  geom_sf(data = ice_pcs, fill = "lightcyan", color = "snow3") +
  geom_sf(data = bear_two_pcs, alpha = 0.3) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(limits["xmin"], limits["xmax"]),
           ylim = c(limits["ymin"], limits["ymax"])) +
  theme_bw()
```

Now we have a plot that is starting to look usable:

```r
bear_plot
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_11.png)

You might want to add things like a north arrow or a scale bar. The `ggspatial` package provides some options for doing this with the functions `annotation_scale()` and `annotation_north_arrow()`.

```r
bear_plot <- bear_plot +
  # Place a scale bar in top left
  annotation_scale(location = "tr") +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tl",
                         # Use true north
                         which_north = "true",
                         height = unit(0.75, "cm"),
                         width = unit(0.75, "cm"))

bear_plot
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_12.png)

For the next step we'll add an inset map to show the geographic context of where this study took place. This map will be zoomed out and show just the state of Alaska for reference. In order to do this we'll need to create a second `ggplot` object and then use `cowplot::ggdraw()` to combine our two maps.

First, create the inset map. We want something pretty basic. The `limits` object we made from `st_bbox()`earlier can be plotted if we run it through `st_as_sfc()` to create a polygon from it.

```r
inset_map <- ggplot(data = alaska_pcs) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sfc(limits), fill = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        plot.background = element_blank())

inset_map
```

![](https://cougrstats.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/fig_13.png)

Now that we've successfully made a map that we want to place as an inset it's time to combine our two `ggplot` objects into one using `ggdraw()`. You'll want to play around with the arguments to your inset `ggdraw()` call until you've arranged it in a way you like.

```r
ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(bear_plot) +
  draw_plot(plot = inset_map,
            x = 0.13, # x location of inset placement
            y = 0.009, # y location of inset placement
            width = .455, # Inset width
            height = .26, # Inset height
            scale = .66) # Inset scale
```

#### 2.3 Taking this further

There are a couple other places you might want to make changes to the map we've created. For one, you might want to use color to code the bear's path by date to show how long it lingered in some locations.

We first will need to create breakpoints that we can feed to `ggplot` for this. We'll use `pretty()` from base R to generate equally spaced dates and corresponding labels for the legend.

You can use `scale_color_viridis_c()` (or another `scale_color_` option if you want) and provide it `dates_num` as the color breaks and `dates_lab` as the break labels. Note that I also add in a fill color for `panel.background` to give the the appearance of water.

```r
bear_time_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alaska_pcs, fill = "seashell", color = "snow3") +
  geom_sf(data = ice_pcs, fill = "lightcyan", color = "snow3") +
  geom_sf(data = bear_two_pcs, aes(color = as.numeric(Date)), alpha = 0.3) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(limits["xmin"], limits["xmax"]),
           ylim = c(limits["ymin"], limits["ymax"])) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(name = "Date",
                        breaks = date_breaks$dates_num,
                        labels = date_breaks$dates_lab) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightseagreen"),
        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  # Place a scale bar in top left
  annotation_scale(location = "tr") +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tl",
                         # Use true north
                         which_north = "true",
                         height = unit(0.75, "cm"),
                         width = unit(0.75, "cm"))

bear_time_plot
```

And lastly, you might want to represent the GPS data as a line instead of a series of points. ([Read here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/321) for a discussion on converting to `LINESTRINGS`). You'll need to convert the points first and then you can plot as normal.

```r
# Convert points to LINESTRING
bear_two_line <- bear_two_pcs %>%
  summarise(do_union = FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING")

bear_time_plot +
  geom_sf(data = bear_two_line, color = "black") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(limits["xmin"], limits["xmax"]),
           ylim = c(limits["ymin"], limits["ymax"]))

## Coordinate system already present. Adding new coordinate system, which will replace the existing one.
```

```r
ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(bear_time_plot +
              geom_sf(data = bear_two_line, color = "black") +
              coord_sf(xlim = c(limits["xmin"], limits["xmax"]),
                       ylim = c(limits["ymin"], limits["ymax"]))) +
  draw_plot(plot = inset_map,
            x = 0.03, # x location of inset placement
            y = 0.009, # y location of inset placement
            width = .455, # Inset width
            height = .26, # Inset height
            scale = .66) # Inset scale

## Coordinate system already present. Adding new coordinate system, which will replace the existing one.
